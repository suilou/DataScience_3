Depository "DataScience_3" contains files for the class project for "Getting and Cleaning the Data". 

The project assignment can be found in "GettingCleaningDataCourseProject_Coursera.pdf".

Metadata and readme files of the raw data can be found in subfolder "RawDataDescriptions".

CookBook.md is the file that gives descriptions about the variables, the data, and processes used to generate "merged_data2.csv" and "meanSet.csv".

"run_analysisR" is an R script that was used to download and process the raw data, and generate output files "merged_data2.csv" and "meanSet.csv". 

"merged_data2.csv" is the merged data with mean and std columns retained (see requirement#4 in "GettingCleaningDataCourseProject_Coursera.pdf"). 

"meanSet.csv" is the independant tidy set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (see requirement#5 in "GettingCleaningDataCourseProject_Coursera.pdf").
